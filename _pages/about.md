I am Soham Chitnis, a final year student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus, pursuing an undergrad in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. My research interests are **Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence**. In my undergraduate thesis at TCS Research, I explored grounding large language models for Chart Understanding. I also investigated the impact of language-image pre-training of the visual encoder on the Chart Visual Question Answering (Chart VQA) task. I have worked on developing a deep learning-based model for cancer diagnosis using histopathology images and the generation of novel drug molecules for cancer cure using Deep Graph Generators. I have worked on  Hyperspectral Images for various downstream tasks. I am a member of [Society for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning](https://www.saidl.in/). I am looking to collaborate on research projects and Research Assistant/ Project Assistant positions.
