I am a first year Masters student at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University (NYU) studying Computer Science with AI Specialization. I graduated from Birla Institute of Technology & Science Pilani (BITS Pilani) in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. 

My research interests are **Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning**. In general I am interested in representation learning, multimodal models, world models, reasoning in models. I also like to work on Applied AI in domains such as Healthcare, Remote Sensing.

I am currently exploring training paradigms for Joint-Embedding Predictive Models (JEPA) and Hierarchical JEPA at [CILVR Lab, NYU](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/) with [Wancong Zhang](https://kevinghst.github.io/) and [Vlad Sobal](https://vladisai.github.io/).

At APPCAIR, I have worked on developing LLM-based agents for review generation of research papers.  In my undergraduate thesis at TCS Research, I explored grounding large language models for Chart Understanding. I also investigated the impact of language-image pre-training of the visual encoder on the Chart Visual Question Answering (Chart VQA) task. I have worked on developing a deep learning-based model for cancer diagnosis using histopathology images and the generation of novel drug molecules for cancer cure using Deep Graph Generators. I have worked on  Hyperspectral Images for various downstream tasks. I am a member of [Society for Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning](https://www.saidl.in/). **I am looking for Summer Internships for 2025.**

I am fortunate to have been guided by [Prof. Ashwin Srinivasan](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ashwin-srinivasan/), [Prof. Tanmay Verlekar](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/tanmay-tulsidas-verlekar/), [Dr. Tirtharaj Dash](https://tirtharajdash.github.io/) at APPCAIR, [Dr. Sidong Liu](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/sidong-liu) at Macquaire University, [Dr. Manasi Patwardhan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=eAM84HQAAAAJ&hl=en) at TCS Research and [Prof. Faisal Qureshi](https://vclab.ca/) at Ontario Tech University.
